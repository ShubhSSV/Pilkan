                <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> The Pilkhan plant (Ficus virens), commonly known as white fig or banyan fig, is valued for its numerous medicinal and environmental benefits. Traditionally, it has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for its therapeutic properties, helping treat digestive issues, respiratory ailments, and skin disorders. The leaves, bark, and roots of the plant are known to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial qualities, which can aid in healing wounds, reducing fever, and enhancing general immunity. Pilkhan also contributes to the ecosystem by supporting soil fertility, serving as a habitat for various wildlife, and improving air quality due to its ability to absorb carbon dioxide effectively.</p>

                <p><strong>Season:</strong> Pilkhan is a resilient, deciduous plant that thrives throughout the year, but it exhibits a particular growth spurt in the monsoon and spring seasons. During the rainy season, it produces fresh foliage and, in certain climates, small fruits that provide sustenance to birds and other wildlife. In drier months, the tree sheds some of its leaves to conserve water, showing its adaptability to diverse seasonal changes. Pilkhanâ€™s seasonal cycle enables it to remain green and beneficial to its surroundings, especially in regions that experience significant variations in climate.</p>

                <p><strong>Region:</strong> Native to the Indian subcontinent, the Pilkhan plant is widely found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in countries like India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. It flourishes in warm, humid climates and can grow in a variety of soils, though it prefers well-drained, fertile ground. Pilkhan is commonly spotted in forests, along riverbanks, and in rural landscapes where it often serves as a shade-giving tree. It has adapted well to urban areas and can sometimes be seen in parks and roadside plantations, playing an important role in local ecosystems across various regions.</p>

                <p><strong>Age:</strong> The Pilkhan plant has an impressive lifespan, capable of living for several hundred years under suitable conditions. Its longevity makes it a vital fixture in many ecosystems and human settlements, as it grows into a large, sprawling tree that provides shade, shelter, and sustenance over generations. Mature Pilkhan trees can reach heights of 20 to 30 meters and continue to thrive with minimal care, making them symbols of endurance and resilience. Its age and stature lend it a revered place in many cultures, where old Pilkhan trees are often associated with local heritage and history.
